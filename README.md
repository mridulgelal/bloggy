# Bloggy

A simple and dynamic blogging platform built with Node.js and Express. Bloggy allows users to sign up, log in, create blogs, and comment on posts. The application leverages JWT cookie-based authentication with salt and paper hashing for secure user sessions, and uses MongoDB as its database. Multer is used for managing blog image uploads.
